                    <p>Madagascar raffia Crochet existed for more than 5 years in Madagascar with just 3 employees at the start. 2023 was a 
                        hub for us because we wanted to invest much more in bag manufacturing
                        in rabane (braided raffia) and crocheted raffia bag. For this, we registered with the State as
                         bag manufacturers and currently we have a Tax Identity Number, a static card and an exporter card.

            HOW TO CROCHET RAFFIA ?
        </h1>
        <p class="container">
            Raffia is a natural fiber that is highly prized for its versatility and strength, used in many areas such as fashion, decoration, and even gardening. In this article, we will show you how to crochet raffia, the techniques for doing so, as well as tips for achieving optimal results. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in crochet, you will discover the specificities of this material and how to make the most of it.

            Raffia comes from the leaves of the Raphia palm tree, native to Madagascar, and is traditionally used to make baskets, hats, bags, and many other crafts. Due to its texture and natural appearance, raffia is also very popular for decoration and creative leisure projects. In the following lines, we will guide you through the different steps to crochet raffia.

            Before you start crocheting raffia, it is important to choose your material and prepare the fiber. You will need a hook adapted to the thickness of the raffia and a little patience to master this technique. So, without further ado, discover how to crochet raffia by following our tips and tricks.
        </p>
        <div class="row g-5 container-fluid">
            <div style="border-radius:2px" class="p-3 d-flex text-left align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column gap-3 col-md-4">
                <h3 style="height:20%">1. Choose and prepare the raffia</h3>
                <p style="height:80%;">
                    To get your raffia crochet project off to a good start, it is essential to choose a quality fiber and prepare it correctly. You can buy raffia in balls or skeins, depending on your preferences. Make sure that the fibers are long and regular enough to make the work easier.
                    Before you start crocheting, unroll and stretch the raffia slightly to soften it. This will make it easier to slide the hook and avoid damaging the fiber. If you are using raffia in a skein, remember to divide it into several strands, depending on the thickness you want for your project.

            <div style="border-radius:2px" class="p-3 d-flex text-left align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column gap-3 col-md-4">
                <h3 style="height:20%">2. Choose the right crochet hook</h3>
                <p style="height:80%">
                    Choosing the right crochet hook is essential for successfully crocheting raffia. Choose a metal, wooden, or plastic crochet hook, with a size that is appropriate for the thickness of your raffia. Generally, a 4 to 6 mm crochet hook is suitable for most projects. Feel free to experiment with different crochet hook sizes to find the one that suits you best.

                <h3 style="height:20%">3. Make the first stitches</h3>
                <p style="height:80%">
                    Start by making a slip knot and make a basic chain, taking care not to tighten the stitches too much. It is important to crochet slightly looser than usual, to allow the raffia to unwind properly and avoid breaking it.
                    Next, make the first stitches of your project following the chosen crochet stitch (single crochet, slip stitch, half double crochet, double crochet, etc.). Simple stitches are generally preferable for raffia projects, as they highlight the texture of the fiber.

                <p style="height:80%">
                    Here are some tips to help you crochet raffia more easily:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Work with clean, dry hands to avoid getting the fiber dirty or damaged.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of each round and make it easier to count the stitches.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Lower the tension of your yarn slightly to avoid breaking the raffia.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Alternate stitches and colors to create patterns and give relief to your work.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="border-radius:2px" class="p-3 d-flex text-left align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column gap-3 col-md-4">
                <h3 style="height:20%">5. Finishing and care of the work</h3>
                <p style="height:80%">
                    Once your work is finished, weave in the raffia threads using a yarn needle or a fine crochet hook. Make a discreet knot and cut off the excess raffia. To care for your raffia creation, it is recommended to hand wash it with lukewarm water and mild soap. Let it dry flat to preserve the shape of your work.
